Common Interview Problems
=========================

Having just graduated with my Computer Science degree I spent a lot of time this
last semester practicing for interviews and interviewing with various companies.
I've interviewed with startups you've probably never heard about that have
single digit employees and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook.

This is a collection of interview problems I've received in the past as well as
some other common interview problems all solved as efficiently as possible. Feel
free to submit pull requests with problems you've been asked in the past.

Some Tips and Things to Study
-----------------------------

### Be Honest
While interviewing if you've seen a problem before just be honest about it.
Don't act like you've never seen this problem before and then pretend to
struggle. Your interviewer has probably asked this question before to many other
candidates and they know what real struggling looks like, they can spot your
(bad) acting from a mile away. Keep in mind your interviewer is trying to figure
if you'd make a good coworker and nobody wants to work with a liar.

### Act Natural
Chances are you've probably spent a good amount of time with fellow engineers so
you know what they're like. If you're doing a technical interview then your
interviewer is going to be an engineer. Don't forget they're judging how good of
a coworker you would make.Just act like you would around other engineers even if
non engineers wouldn't consider your behavior to be normal.

### String Manipulation
While manipulating strings might be easy make sure you know how to efficiently
mutate strings in your language of choice.

For example, if you're using Java and you use a String instead of StringBuilder
you're going to get laughed at.

### Hash Tables
**This is the most important Data Structure**

They are O(1) to insert, delete, and get. To quote my data structures professor
"Hash Tables are the blue dream of data structures"

Every language has it's own implementation and you better know how to use it in
the language you're interviewing with. Many of the problems you receive in an
interview can be easily and efficiently solved using hash tables.

For every single problem you get during an interview your first thought should
be "can I solve this using a hash table?", I can tell you from experience that
there is a pretty good chance you can.

### Bit Manipulation
For most people these seem to be the hardest problems. Typically if you solved
a problem with a hash table and your interviewer says the dreaded words "Good,
now do it without extra space" this means its time to whip out your knowledge
of boolean algebra.

Try to translate binary operations into normal terms. If you are trying to see
what bits are different in two binary strings then XOR will do the trick but if
you want to see what is identical in two binary strings then AND will do it.

### Design Questions
These typically do not involve coding but at times will involve coding. When
these questions do require coding it usually does not involve any complex 
algorithms so do not worry. 

Make sure you know good Object Oriented practices and how to scale your
application. For these questions there are no right answers but plenty of wrong
answers. 

**Be prepared to answer the question "Why?".** Regardless of how good of a 
certain design decision is there is a good chance they are going to tell you
something that you could've done instead. **This doesn't mean that what you said
is wrong or that you should back down.** Argue your point and if you know what 
you're talking about then this interview should be a breeze.
